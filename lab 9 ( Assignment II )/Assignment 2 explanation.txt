

This is a C++ program that demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism
 in object-oriented programming. It defines a Publication class, which has a title
 and price, and two derived classes, Book and Tape, which add a page count and playing time in minutes, respectively.

Let's go through each line of the code and understand what it does:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

This line includes the necessary header files for input/output and string handling.

class Publication {
private:
    string title;
    float price;
public:
    Publication() : title(""), price(0.0) {}
    Publication(string t, float p) : title(t), price(p) {}
    void getData() {
        cout << "Enter title: ";
        getline(cin, title);
        cout << "Enter price: ";
        cin >> price;
        cin.ignore(); // consume newline
    }
    void putData() const {
        cout << "Title: " << title << endl;
        cout << "Price: " << price << endl;
    }
};

This is the Publication class declaration. It has two private data members,
 title and price, and two constructors - a default constructor that initializes
 the data members to their default values, and a parameterized constructor that
 initializes them with given values. The class also has two member functions, 
getData() and putData(), that respectively get input from the user and output the object's data.

class Book : public Publication {
private:
    int pageCount;
public:
    Book() : Publication(), pageCount(0) {}
    Book(string t, float p, int pc) : Publication(t, p), pageCount(pc) {}
    void getData() {
        Publication::getData();
        cout << "Enter page count: ";
        cin >> pageCount;
        cin.ignore(); // consume newline
    }
    void putData() const {
        Publication::putData();
        cout << "Page count: " << pageCount << endl;
    }
};

This is the Book class declaration, which inherits from the Publication class 
using the public keyword. It has a private data member, pageCount, and two constructors
 - a default constructor that initializes the pageCount to 0, and a parameterized 
constructor that initializes it with a given value. The class also has two member 
functions, getData() and putData(), that respectively get input from the user and 
output the object's data, and call the corresponding functions in the base class using the scope resolution operator.

class Tape : public Publication {
private:
    float playingTime;
public:
    Tape() : Publication(), playingTime(0.0) {}
    Tape(string t, float p, float pt) : Publication(t, p), playingTime(pt) {}
    void getData() {
        Publication::getData();
        cout << "Enter playing time (minutes): ";
        cin >> playingTime;
        cin.ignore(); // consume newline
    }
    void putData() const {
        Publication::putData();
        cout << "Playing time (minutes): " << playingTime << endl;
    }
};

This is the Tape class declaration, which also inherits from the Publication class
 using the public keyword. It has a private data member, playingTime, and two constructors
 - a default constructor that initializes the playingTime to 0, and a parameterized 
constructor that initializes it with a given value. The class also has two member 
functions, getData() and putData(), that respectively get input from the user and 
output the object's data, and call the corresponding functions in the base class
 using the scope resolution operator.

int main() {
    Book b;
    Tape t;
    b.getData();
    t.getData();
    cout << endl <<

The main function is where the Book and Tape classes are instantiated
 and their methods are called to get and display data. First, two objects
 are created: Book b and Tape t. These objects are instances of the Book 
and Tape classes respectively. Then, the getData method is called on the
 Book object b. This method prompts the user to enter the title, price, and 
page count of the book, and stores these values in the b object. Similarly, 
the getData method is called on the Tape object t. This method prompts the 
user to enter the title, price, and playing time of the tape, and stores these
 values in the t object. After getting data for both objects, the putData method
 is called on the Book object b. This method displays the title, price, and page
 count of the book. Then, the putData method is called on the Tape object t. This
 method displays the title, price, and playing time of the tape. Finally, the program
 returns 0 to indicate that it has run successfully.

*** why cin.ignore(); in the code?
In the code, cin.ignore(); is used to clear the input buffer before calling getline() function.

When we read input using cin for example cin >> variable, the input buffer may contain
 newline characters (i.e., '\n') that were left there by the previous input operation.
 These newline characters are still in the input buffer and can be read by the next 
input operation, even if it's not intended.

In the code, after reading input using cin >> for pageCount and playTime,
 we use cin.ignore() to remove any leftover newline character(s) from the
 input buffer, so that the subsequent getline() call does not read any 
unintended input. If we didn't do this, the getline() call would be skipped
 because it would immediately read the newline character left in the buffer
 by the previous input operation
