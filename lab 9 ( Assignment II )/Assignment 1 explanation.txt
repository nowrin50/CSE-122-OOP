
here's the line-by-line explanation of the code:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

These lines include the necessary libraries and namespace for the code.

class Animal {
protected:
    int age;
    long uniqueID;
    bool alive;
    pair<double, double> location;
public:
    Animal() : age(0), uniqueID(rand()), alive(true), location(make_pair(0.0, 0.0)) {}


Animal(int age, double x, double y) : age(age), uniqueID(rand()), alive(true), location(make_pair(x, y)) {}

    virtual void move(double x, double y) {
        location.first = x;
        location.second = y;
        cout << "Animal has moved to location: (" << location.first << ", " << location.second << ")" << endl;
    }

    Animal(const Animal& other) {
        age = other.age;
        uniqueID = other.uniqueID;
        alive = other.alive;
        location = other.location;
    }


virtual ~Animal() {}

    virtual void sleep() {
        cout << "Animal is sleeping" << endl;


}

    virtual void eat() {
        cout << "Animal is eating" << endl;
    }

    void setAlive(bool isAlive) {
        alive = isAlive;
    }

    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Animal& animal) {
        os << "Animal ID: " << animal.uniqueID << endl;
        os << "Age: " << animal.age << endl;
        os << "Alive: " << (animal.alive ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
        os << "Location: (" << animal.location.first << ", " << animal.location.second << ")" << endl;
        return os;
    }
};


This code defines the base class Animal, which has protected member variables age, uniqueID, alive, and location.
 The class also has a default constructor that initializes these variables, a parameterized constructor that takes
 age, x, and y as arguments, a move function that changes the location of the animal, and virtual functions sleep 
and eat that display messages. The class also has a friend function to overload the << operator and display the member variables.

class Bird : public Animal {
public:
    Bird() : Animal() {}

    Bird(int age, double x, double y) : Animal(age, x, y) {}

    virtual void move(double x, double y) override {
        location.first = x;
        location.second = y;
        cout << "Bird has flown to location: (" << location.first << ", " << location.second << ")" << endl;
    }



virtual void sleep() override {
        cout << "Bird is sleeping" << endl;
    }

    virtual void eat() override {
        cout << "Bird is eating seeds" << endl;
    }
};

The Bird class is derived from the Animal class using the public inheritance. It has three constructors: 
the default constructor that initializes the object with default values, a constructor that initializes 
the object with the given age, x and y coordinates, and the copy constructor that copies the values from 
an existing Bird object. The move() function is overridden to print a message indicating that the bird has
 flown to a new location. The sleep() and eat() functions are also overridden to indicate that the bird is sleeping and eating seeds, respectively.

class Canine : public Animal {
public:
    Canine() : Animal() {}



Canine(int age, double x, double y) : Animal(age, x, y) {}

    virtual void move(double x, double y) override {
        location.first = x;
        location.second = y;
        cout << "Canine has walked to location: (" << location.first << ", " << location.second << ")" << endl;
    }

    virtual void sleep() override {
        cout << "Canine is sleeping" << endl;
    }

    virtual void eat() override {
        cout << "Canine is eating meat" << endl;
    }
};



This code defines another derived class called Canine, which inherits from Animal. It has the same constructor
 format as the Bird class, with one constructor that takes no arguments and another that takes three arguments
 for age, x, and y. The Canine class overrides the move, sleep, and eat methods of its base class. The move method 
prints out a message indicating that the Canine has walked to a new location, while the sleep and eat methods print 
messages indicating that the Canine is sleeping and eating meat, respectively


int main() {
    Animal animal1(5, 1.0, 2.0);
    Bird bird1(2, 3.0, 4.0);
    Canine canine1(3, 5.0, 6.0);

    cout << "Animal Details:" << endl << animal1 << endl;
    cout << "Bird Details:" << endl << bird1 << endl;
    cout << "Canine Details:" << endl << canine1 << endl;

    cout << "Moving the animals..." << endl;

    animal1.move(7.0, 8.0);
    bird1.move(9.0, 10.0);
    canine1.move(11.0, 12.0);


cout << "Animal Details after move:" << endl << animal1 << endl;
    cout << "Bird Details after move:" << endl << bird1 << endl;
    cout << "Canine Details after move:" << endl << canine1 << endl;

    cout << "Making the animals sleep and eat..." << endl;

    animal1.sleep();
    animal1.eat();

    bird1.sleep();
    bird1.eat();

    canine1.sleep();
    canine1.eat();

    cout << "Setting the animals to dead..." << endl;

    animal1.setAlive(false);

bird1.setAlive(false);
    canine1.setAlive(false);

    cout << "Animal Details after setAlive:" << endl << animal1 << endl;
    cout << "Bird Details after setAlive:" << endl << bird1 << endl;
    cout << "Canine Details after setAlive:" << endl << canine1 << endl;

    return 0;
}


Finally, the main function creates three objects: animal1 of type Animal, bird1 of type Bird, and canine1 of type Canine.
 Each object is initialized with a specific age, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate. The function then prints out details about
 each object, including its unique ID, age, alive status, and location. The program then moves each animal to a new location
 using its move method and prints out the details of each animal again. Next, the program calls the sleep and eat methods for
 each animal, which prints out messages indicating that each animal is sleeping and eating.
